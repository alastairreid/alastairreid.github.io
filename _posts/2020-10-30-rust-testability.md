title: "Rust Design-for-Testability: a survey"
layout: post
---

What can we do when designing Rust code to make it easier to test?
This is a survey of everything I could find[^survey-method] about
testing Rust with a particular focus on design for testability for
correctness.  Some of the articles show multiple things to do on a
worked example, some are more focused on a particular trick.

[^survey-method]:
     By “everything I could find”, I mean that I searched for terms
     relating to “design for test”, “testability”, “Rust”, etc. and
     followed links in other blogs. I also searched the archives of
     “[This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)” for the
     word “test” and followed any promising links.

There doesn’t seem to be a single place that describes all the testing
ideas: it is scattered across book chapters, blog articles, medium
articles, etc. but here are the main sources that I have found.

*   [The Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) chapter on testing
*   [Testing command line applications in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html)
    (significant overlap with the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html))
*   [How to organize your Rust tests](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/)
    Probably the most exhaustive / thorough
*   [Testing sync at Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine) --
    what they did in their Rust rewrite to improve testability
*   [Rust by example book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/testing.html) chapter on testing
*   [Writing fuzzable code](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687) --
    John Regehr’s blog (not specifically about Rust)
*   [Testable Component Design in Rust](https://www.zcfy.cc/original/testable-component-design-in-rust-iextendable)
*   [Rust 2020: Testing](https://knowitlabs.no/rust-2020-testing-4ab3d80112ba)
*   [How to use the Rust compiler as your integration testing framework](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-the-rust-compiler-as-your-integration-testing-framework/)

*   [A practical test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) -- Martin Fowler’s blog (not specifically about Rust)

I am not going to try to summarize what these sources say: the rest of
this post is a list of some common / interesting topics and which of
these sources describe it in more detail.

Although my main focus is on how to write Rust programs so that they are easy
to test, I touch on the other half of the problem: how to do the testing.



*[I am new to Rust and my own testing habits are somewhat ad-hoc so this is
definitely not a recommendation of how to write software by me.  I hope it is
useful and that you will tell me what I have missed
[on twitter](https://twitter.com/alastair_d_reid) or
[by email](mailto:alastair.d.reid@gmail.com)
so that I can update this post.
I would love to hear about any team that has published recommendations for
design-for-testability.]*


## Design techniques for improving testability

The sources listed above have a bunch of common suggestions that I
explore in more detail below. Many of the sources I found have great
discussions so I will not try to repeat their explanations in this
document but will link to some of the better discussions of each idea
that I found.


### Use intermediate data structures

See:
[Testing sync](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine),
[Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html),
[Testing CLI applications](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html),
[use the Rust compiler for integration testing](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-the-rust-compiler-as-your-integration-testing-framework/)

*   Use intermediate data structures to separate deciding what to do
    from performing the action: allowing tests to check that the right
    decision is being made and avoiding the need to mock/fake the
    filesystem, etc.
*   Aggressively use newtypes, structs, enums
*   Parse and validate inputs early (eg convert strings to enums)
*   Also, #[must\_use], parse/validate early
*   [Writing I/O-Free (Sans-I/O) Protocol Implementations](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html) (not Rust specific)


### Abstract testable code into separate functions

See:
[Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html),
[Testing CLI applications](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html)

*   Cleanly separate command line parsing from code that implements functionality


### Abstract I/O and state side effects out of functions

See:
[Testing CLI applications](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html),
[Writing fuzzable code](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687),
[Testing sync](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine)

*   Use of std::io::Write trait and writeln! instead of println! (and handle resulting potential error)


### Avoid / reduce non-determinism

See:
[Testing sync](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-testing-our-new-sync-engine),
[Writing fuzzable code](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687)

*   Use Futures with a custom executor to eliminate the
    non-determinism of threads
*   All randomized testing systems should be fully deterministic
    and easily reproducible
*   Beware of additional randomness in libraries:
    e.g., Rust’s HashMap uses randomized hashing to protect against denial of service attacks.
    This makes testing harder.
*   Determinism enables minimization of random tests
    (cf. [proptest](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/shrinking-basics.html))


### Defining correct behavior

See:
[Writing fuzzable code](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687)

*   [Oracles for random testing](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/856) (not Rust specific)
    *   Use Function inverse pairs (eg print/parse functions)
    *   Compare two implementations
*   Use asserts liberally
*   [Turn on sanitizers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html)
*   [Contracts.rs](https://docs.rs/contracts/0.6.0/contracts/)
    / [(crates.io link)](https://crates.io/crates/contracts) -- code contract library
*   [inactive?] [libhoare](https://github.com/nrc/libhoare) compiler plugin


### Dependency injection and mock testing

See:
[Rust 2020: Testing](https://knowitlabs.no/rust-2020-testing-4ab3d80112ba),
[Testable Component Design in Rust](https://www.zcfy.cc/original/testable-component-design-in-rust-iextendable)

*   Abstraction can be based on Higher order functions or objects
*   Traits and [mockall](https://github.com/asomers/mockall)
*   Module mocks using [mocktopus](https://github.com/CodeSandwich/Mocktopus)


### API design

See:
[Testing CLI applications](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html),
[Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html),
[If you use Unsafe, …](http://erickt.github.io/blog/2015/09/22/if-you-use-unsafe/),
[Testable Component Design](https://www.zcfy.cc/original/testable-component-design-in-rust-iextendable),
[Writing Correct, Readable and Performant (CRaP)](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-write-crap-rust-code/)

API design strongly affects testability of that API

*   The component should provide a stable contract composed of traits, structs, and enums
*   Always implement Clone and fmt::Debug for public types
    *   types like failure::Error should be converted to something that is cloneable
*   Use ‘newtype’ to let the type system statically test for errors and use
    one of these to test that this is done correctly

    - [compiletest.rs](https://github.com/laumann/compiletest-rs)
      for testing Rust compilations
    - [lang_tester](https://crates.io/crates/lang_tester/)
      for testing compilations including, but not limited to, Rust
    - the fuzzy text matcher [fm](https://crates.io/crates/fm)

*   Use #![warn(missing\_doc\_code\_examples)]
    (and other [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html))


## Writing tests

See:
[How to organize your Rust tests](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/),
[Testing CLI applications](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html),
[Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/testing.html),

Having structured your software to enable tests, there are a lot of
different tools and libraries to support writing tests.

*   Documentation tests
*   [How to organize your Rust tests](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/)
*   [Fuzzing book](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/):
    describes use of [cargo-fuzz](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html)
    and [afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs).
    See: [Rust Fuzzing Authority](https://github.com/rust-fuzz)
*   Use [QuickCheck](https://docs.rs/quickcheck) or [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest)
    for generative testing / property-based testing
*   Unit tests vs integration tests
*   Using [assert\_cmd](https://docs.rs/assert_cmd) crate to test applications
    (link has links to other useful crates)
*   Better error reporting using one of
    - [anyhow crate](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.33/anyhow/) -- adding context to error messages
    - [color eyre crate](https://docs.rs/color-eyre/0.5.6/color_eyre/) --
      extends anyhow with .suggestion() and other context

*   Use the {:?} and {:x?} Debug string formats in test harnesses
    (see [std/fmt](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting-traits))
*   [Rutenspitz](https://github.com/jakubadamw/rutenspitz):
    procedural macros for testing (fuzzing) equivalence of two
    stateful models (e.g., data structures)


### Test / Behavior driven design (TDD and BDD)

See: [Rust testing tricks](https://blog.cyplo.dev/posts/2018/09/rust-testing-tricks/),
[From @test to #[test]: Java to Rust](https://mateuscosta.me/testing-between-java-and-rust)

Obviously, there are many, many articles about TDD, BDD, Agile, etc.
in the context of Java and other OO languages. The following links are
Rust specific but they are a bit random and need to be improved.

*   [Laboratory.rs](https://crates.io/crates/laboratory) --
    BDD-inspired test library (todo: are other BDD libraries maybe more popular?)

## More information

My interest in Rust testing is a hope/belief that a good way of making formal
verification more accessible to software developers is to build on what they
are already familiar with: testing.
I described this [last month][Rust testing or verifying: Why not both].
