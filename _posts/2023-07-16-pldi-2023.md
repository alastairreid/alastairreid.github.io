I was long overdue to attend a conference in person: the last conference I attended was [POPL 2020](https://popl20.sigplan.org/).
This year's [PLDI](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/) was in Orlando, Florida at the height of a hot, humid summer in the largest conference
center I have ever seen (we did a lot of walking within the conference center).
PLDI was co-located with other conferences including
the hardware conference ISCA as part of the [Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC)](https://fcrc.acm.org/)
and I dropped in on a few of the ISCA talks.

There were two tracks so I didn't attend all the talks but some of the themes in the talks I did attend were
as follows (there were lots of other great papers in [the program](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/program/program-pldi-2023/)).

- Sparse matrix multiply,
  Tensors,
  Transformers
  and Machine learning.
  In particular, ways of generating and combining high performance implementations.
  [bansal:pldi:2023]
  [kovach:pldi:2023]

- Formally verified software,
  and fast crypto implementations
  [kuepper:pldi:2023]

- Extending and using SMT solvers
  [wang:pldi:2023]

- Quantum computing
  [chen:pldi:2023]

- Undefined Behaviour in C
  [isemann:pldi:2023]

- Fuzzing and testing
  [livinskii:pldi:2023]

- Information leakage,
  non-interference
  and Approximate model counting
  [saha:pldi:2023]
  [eilers:pldi:2023]

- Memory management,
  and parallelism
  [arora:pldi:2023]

- Defunctionalization
  [brandon:pldi:2023]

- Synthesis
  [guria:pldi:2023]

- Separation logic
  [liu:pldi:2023]

- Type systems
  [nigam:pldi:2023]

In other words, [this is still PLDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMCl64Uhe8).


One of the most interesting talks was about a type system inspired by incorrectness logic used to reason
about whether a random test generator was theoretically capable of generating all possible input values
[zhou:pldi:2023].
Just as incorrectness logic turns Hoare logic on its head, so their type system turns normal typing
rules on their head.


And I dropped in on my colleague Sam Coward's E-graphs talk about his extensions to E-graphs to support
the use of egg to generate efficient floating point hardware. (See [coward:arxiv:2023] for
the related paper.)

I also enjoyed the Plenary Talks I attended

- "Computing in the foundation model era"
  by Kunle Olukotun, Stanford University
  [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gADw3NtGDVE&list=PLn0nrSd4xjjZ5DcBqu8xxoFQ3QjqAaQXl&index=1)

  This was about designing hardware for constructing large language models and how his students'
  research has fed into a startup that is creating chips (and racks) for machine learning.

- "Constructing & deconstructing trust: Employing cryptographic recipe in the ML domain"
  by Shafi Goldwasser, University of California Berkeley
  [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHinDYWpZDQ&list=PLn0nrSd4xjjZ5DcBqu8xxoFQ3QjqAaQXl&index=4)

  This was about taking all the understanding of threat models, attacks, etc. developed
  by the cryptographic community and using that
  to think about the known attacks and potential vulnerabilities in the creation and use of
  machine learning models.

But, really, I went to catch up with colleagues that I had not seen for several years;
to meet researchers whose work I knew but had never met;
and for the random meetings, dinners and introductions that happen in the "corridor track".
