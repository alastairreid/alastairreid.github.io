One of the tantalising pieces of information contained in [ARM's machine
readable specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2017-04-20-ARM-v8a-xml-release %}) is a specification of the assembly syntax.
A few years ago (on an earlier) version of the specification, Wojciech Meyer
and I decided to try to transform this specification into assemblers and
disassemblers.
At the time, this was not very useful to ARM because we already had assemblers
and disassemblers so, although technically successful, the project died and
the code has been slowly bitrotting ever since.
In a few days time, I will be giving a [talk at the 34th Chaos Communication
Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/events/8915.html)
[[video](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8915-how_can_you_trust_formally_verified_software)]
[[pdf](/talks/using-arm-specs-34C3-2017-12-27.pdf)]
in
Leipzig about practical things you can do with ARM's specification and
I thought it would be a good idea to suggest that someone creates a similar
tool.
But maybe it would be a good idea if I showed you what Wojciech and I did to
get you started?

## The ARM assembly specification

Let's start by digging into [the HTML rendering of the ARM
spec](https://www.meriac.com/archex/) with [the ADD
instruction](https://www.meriac.com/archex/A64_v83A_ISA/add_addsub_imm.xml).
The assembly syntax is in four parts.
The first two parts show you the opcode diagram and the overall assembly syntax and
is almost directly usable as a specification.

![Opcode and overall assembly syntax]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/assembly_syntax_opcode.png)

The third part describes what symbols like "\<Wd\|WSP\>" mean and will take a bit
of massaging into usable form.

![Assembler symbols]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/assembly_syntax_symbols.png)

And the final part describes aliases such as [using "ADD \<Wd\>, \<SP\>, #0"
as an alias for "MOV \<Wd\>, SP"](https://www.meriac.com/archex/A64_v83A_ISA/mov_add_addsub_imm.xml).
This consists of [a link to a page describing the
alias](https://www.meriac.com/archex/A64_v83A_ISA/mov_add_addsub_imm.xml) and
a condition written in ASL for when the alias is legal/preferred.

![Assembler aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/assembly_syntax_aliases.png)

And, all this information is present in the XML file so it is very easy to
extract.

The only thing that is not quite usable in the above is the assembler symbols.
So let's think about what we could use instead.

## A better spec of the assembler symbols

The assembler specification is full of sentences like "Is the 64-bit name of
the destination general-purpose register or stack pointer, encoded in the "Rd"
field."

All that means is that, given the field "Rd" that the opcode defines as a 5-bit
field in bits 4:0 of the opcode, we need to generate a string that will either
be "X0", "X1", ... "X30" or "SP".  This pattern is going to come up a lot 
so let's extend [ARM's Architecture Specification Language (ASL)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-17-specification_languages %}) with a new function "RegXSP"

    string RegXSP(integer x)
        if x == 31 then
            return "XSP";
        else
            StringConcat("X", DecimalString(x));

With this function, we can now define what the symbol "\<Xd\|SP\>" means in ASL

    <Xd|SP> = RegXSP(UInt(Rd));

(Wherever possible, I prefer to keep the formal specification as close to the
original specification as possible.  So I am choosing to allow identifiers to
have normal looking syntax like "Rd" and some funky syntax like "\<Xd\|SP\>" and
"\<imm\>".)

In the same way, I can define most of the rest of the assembler symbols

    <Xd|SP> = RegXSP(UInt(Rd));
    <Xn|SP> = RegXSP(UInt(Rn));
    <imm>   = DecimalString(UInt(imm12));

But the "\<shift\>" symbol is a bit more complicated because it is optional and
it is defined using a table.

![Shift symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/assembly_syntax_shift.png)

One of the things I noticed comparing the English prose parts of ARM
specifications with their formal counterparts is that tables in text often
correspond to case expressions or case statements in ASL.
So I decided to translate the table into a case expression.

    case shift {
        '00' <-> "LSL #0";
        '01' <-> "LSL #12";
        '1x' <-> RESERVED();
    }

(Note that the discriminant in this expression is the opcode field "shift" which we
should not confuse with "\<shift\>" which is the assembler symbol we are trying
to define.)

To deal with the fact that the field is optional, I decided to define another
function "Optional" that will throw an exception if its input matches some
pattern and, otherwise, will return its input

    string Optional(string pattern, string x)
        if x == pattern then
            throw OPTIONAL;
        else
            return x;

(This would probably be better handled by having the function return
"Option[string]" but ASL does not currently support this kind of type constructor.)

With this in place, we can finish the definition of "\<shift\>"

    <shift> = Optional("LSL #0", 
              case shift {
               '00' <-> "LSL #0";
               '01' <-> "LSL #12";
               '1x' <-> RESERVED();
              });

And our complete specification of the assembly syntax is as follows.

    [sf:'1'; op:'0'; S:'0'; '10001'; shift:'xx'; imm12:'xxxxxxxxxxxx'; Rn:'xxxxx'; Rd:'xxxxx'] 
    <->
    "ADD" " " <Xd|SP> "," " " <Xn|SP> "," " " [ "#" ] <imm> " " [ "," " " <shift> ]
        where
            <Xd|SP> = RegXSP(UInt(Rd));
            <Xn|SP> = RegXSP(UInt(Rn));
            <imm>   = DecimalString(UInt(imm12));
            <shift> = Optional("LSL #0", 
                      case shift {
                       '00' <-> "LSL #0";
                       '01' <-> "LSL #12";
                       '1x' <-> RESERVED();
                      });

## Using the specification as a disassembler

We can execute this specification as follows.

1. Check whether the opcode matches each field of the pattern at the top.
   A bit position in the field pattern is either '1', '0' or 'x' which means
   either 1 or 0.

2. Extract the value of each named field of the opcode.  So, from '0x9104\_0001' we extract

        sf    = '1'
        op    = '0'
        S     = '0'
        shift = '00'
        imm12 = '0001 0000 0000'
        Rn    = '00000'
        Rd    = '00001'

3. Evaluate each term of the overall assembly syntax.
   Literal strings evaluate as themselves, identifiers such as "\<Xd\|SP\>"
   trigger evaluation of the corresponding definition and "[ ... ]" indicates
   an optional field.
   If evaluating an optional field throws an OPTIONAL exception, the result is
   an empty string.
   All the resulting strings are concatenated to get the complete disassembly.

   In this case, the assembler symbols evaluate to

        <Xd|SP> = "X1"
        <Xn|SP> = "X0"
        <imm>   = "256"
        <shift> = throw OPTIONAL

   So the overall disassembly is

       ADD X1, X0, #256

## Using the specification as an assembler

More interestingly, we can execute the specification as an assembler by
evaluating each expression in reverse.
The way this works is that we interpret the overall assembly syntax as
a grammar rule and try to match tokens in the syntax against the input.

For example, we can try to match the string

    "ADD   X1, X0, 256".

against this rule

    "ADD" " " <Xd|SP> "," " " <Xn|SP> "," " " [ "#" ] <imm> " " [ "," " " <shift> ]


1. Match the first terminal "ADD" against the start of the string leaving "  X1, X0, 256".

2. Match the second terminal " " against one or more spaces leaving "X1, X0, 256".

3. Match the non-terminal "\<Xd\|SP\>" by trying to match its definition "RegXSP(UInt(Rd))".

4. Match "RegXSP(e)" by looking for a maximal string matching the regexp "X[0-9]\*\|SP".
   If it matches, match the digit string or the string "31" against "e".
   This gives the string "1" to be matched against "UInt(d)" and leaves the
   string ", X0, 256"

   (I treat "RegXSP", "UInt", etc. as builtin functions that the assembler just "knows".
   I have about 20 builtins like this so this is not too much work but you
   could probably get away with less.)

5. Match "1" against "UInt(Rd)" and bind the variable "Rd" to the bitvector "00001".

6. Similarly, we match "\<Xn\|SP\>" and bind "Rn" to the bitvector "00000"
   leaving ", 256".

7. Match the nonterminals "," and " " against ", " leaving "256" to be matched.

8. The string "256" does not match "#" so skip the optional sequence in
   square brackets.

9. Match the non-terminal "\<imm\>" against "256" and bind "imm12" against
   '0001 0000 0000' leaving an empty string to be matched.

10. The empty string does not match "," so skip the optional sequence in square
    brackets but, since it contains a non-terminal, try to match it against
    "throw OPTIONAL". This requires that the two arguments of "Optional()"
    match so we have to match the case expression "case shift { ... }"
    against the string "LSL #0".

11. Match the string "LSL #0" against the right hand side of each alternative
    in the case expression.  It matches the right hand side of this alternative

        '00' <-> "LSL #0"

    so bind the discriminant "shift" to the value '00'.

The result of all this is that the parse succeeded and we have the following
bindings

    Rd    = '00001'
    Rn    = '00000'
    imm12 = '0001 0000 0000'
    shift = '00'

so we can assemble the complete bitvector:

    [sf:'1'; op:'0'; S:'0'; '10001'; shift:'00'; imm12:'0001 0000 0000'; Rn:'00000'; Rd:'000001']

giving the opcode 0x9104\_0001.


## Transforming the assembler symbols spec into ASL

Now that we know what we want the definition to look like, we need some way to
transform ARM's specification into the ASL extension
sketched above.
The tables are clearly represented in the XML representation but what are we to
do with all that English prose?
The approach that Wojciech and I used is a bit brute force, a but ugly but it
got the job done.
We made a list of all the unique strings we needed to match across all the different
instructions and wrote a series of regexps to match them all.
For example here are some of the replacements used for references to registers

    // Handling of general register fields
    s = s.replace(" 32-bit register or SP",     " REG_WSP")
    s = s.replace(" 32-bit general register",   " REG_WZR")
    s = s.replace(" 64-bit general register",   " REG_XZR")
    s = s.replace(" half-precision register",   " REG_H")
    s = s.replace(" single-precision register", " REG_S")
    s = s.replace(" double-precision register", " REG_D")
    s = s.replace(" 8 bit FP/SIMD register",    " REG_B")

These help to normalise the different ways of referring to registers so that
later patterns like these can finish the job off.

    s = s.replaceAll("Is the (.*)REG_([^ ]*) (.*)encoded in \"(.*)\" plus (.*) modulo 32", "Reg(\"$2\",(UInt($4)+$5) MOD 32)")
    s = s.replaceAll("Is the (.*)REG_([^ ]*) (.*)encoded in \"(.*)\".  Defaults to (.*) if absent", "optional(\"$5\",Reg$5(\"$2\",UInt($4)))")
    s = s.replaceAll("Is the optional (.*)REG_(X[^ ]*) defaulting to '11111' encoded in \"(.*)\"", "optional(\"XZR\",RegXZR(\"$2\",UInt($3)))")

This is the part of our work that has bitrotted the most so I won't show
any more of this --- but hopefully you get the idea.

## Conclusion

This part of the project to formalise the ARM architecture specification was
both a technical success and a tech transfer failure.

On the one hand, it worked: we tested the disassembler against hand-written
disassemblers on all 2^32 encodings; we tested that assembling the disassembly
of any opcode results in the same opcode on all 2^32 encodings.

But, there was no demand within the company for this work because ARM already
hand-written assemblers and disassemblers and because the GNU assembler contribution
rules would have required contribution of the source files that we use to
generate the XML and all the scripts that generate the XML and lots and lots of other parts of the
sausage factory.
So, with no potential consumer of my improved specification, I was not able to persuade the team maintaining the assembly
specification to change to my ASL-based syntax instead of English prose.

That is the way it is in industrial research sometimes: timing is a very
important part of successful research projects.

People have written to tell me about similar projects for ARM disassembly:

- Agustin Gianni wrote [retools: a reverse engineering toolkit for normies](https://github.com/agustingianni/retools) based 
 on scraping the assembly syntax out of PDF files.
- Nick Spinale is writing [hs-arm](https://github.com/nspin/hs-arm) based on the XML spec.
