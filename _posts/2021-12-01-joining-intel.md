Today I am joining Intel Strategic CAD Labs to work on formal specifications.
There's not much to say so far because I've only just started but
I think it's going to be a lot of fun (and a lot of work).
I figure that a lot of the first month or two will be spent figuring out what
people want to do with formal specifications so, if you think that this will be
relevant to you, please get in touch.
I am equally interested in uses that are on my list of [uses for ISA specifications]
and uses that I haven't even thought of.
