In my [last post about natural language specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
post_url 2017-08-19-natural-specs %}), I talked about the problem with
executable specifications: they are great for specifying existing behaviour but
they are bad about describing overall properties and, in particular, what is
_not allowed_ to happen.  This makes it possible that extensions that add
new behaviour could break fundamental properties of the specification without
anybody noticing.

My solution was to revisit some of the English prose in Arm's architecture
specification manual that states invariants and cross-cutting properties
about security, exceptions, etc.
This post talks about how we can verify these properties and some of what
I found when I applied my tools to the v8-M specification of Arm's
microcontrollers.

(This post is based on some of the ideas in my forthcoming OOPSLA 2017 paper
["Who guards the guards?  Formal Validation of the Arm v8-M Architecture
Specification"]({{ site.url }}/papers/OOPSLA_17/).)

# How to prove properties of specifications

There are two ways that you can mechanically prove that something is true.  The
first is the way we learned to prove things in school or university: by making
a series of logical arguments involving rules of arithmetic, logic, etc.  This
is a very powerful approach that (ignoring G&ouml;del) can prove
anything you want to prove.  The only downsides are that it [is very hard
work](https://ts.data61.csiro.au/publications/nictaabstracts/Matichuk_MAJKS_15.abstract.pml) and
that it requires a lot of practice to learn how to write these proofs.

The other way is to use a black box tool like a [SAT
Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Algorithms_for_solving_SAT),
an [SMT
Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories#SMT_solver_approaches)
or a [model checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking#Tools) that
can prove the property for me without requiring me to detail every step.  Since
the computer is doing all the work, these tend to be more computationally
expensive but, thanks to a combination of Moore's Law and better algorithms,
they are fast enough to be useful.  The upside of these solvers is that they
require much less expertise to use them so they are much easier to deploy in an
industrial setting.
One other important property of using these black box solvers that is useful is
that when they find that a property is not true, they provide a counterexample:
a set of inputs for which the property is not true.  These counterexamples are incredibly
useful because it gives me a familiar debug experience: system fails for input
X, let's figure out why.

The major downside is that they can't prove everything.  There are two sides to
this.  The first is that they run out of memory or get stuck trying the wrong
way to solve some problem and, because they are a black box, it is not always
clear how you can help them.

The other limitation is that they can basically only answer one question: is
there an input X such that property P holds?

&exist; X. P

Although, since the tool can definitively tell you "no, there is no such X",
you can interpret a "no" answer as a proof of this property

&forall; X. &not; P

So my task was easy: convert properties written in ASL into SMT expressions.
How hard could that be?

# Converting ASL to SMT

ASL is quite a rich language: it has function calls, assignments,
if-statements, for-loops, while loops, polymorphism,
dependent types, exceptions, arithmetic operations, logical operators, arrays, etc.
SMT is a pure expression language: it has arithmetic operations, logical
operators and arrays _and nothing else_.
So to convert ASL to SMT, all I have to do is remove every convenient
programming feature and turn the entire thing into a giant, unstructured
expression.

Fortunately, I had previously had to figure out how to turn ASL into 
Verilog.  Verilog is more expressive than SMT but not by much so I could
reuse many of the same transformations.  For example, to get rid of
polymorphism and dependent types, I use two transformations: specialization
and monomorphization.

### Specialization

Specialization is used to simplify calls
to polymorphic functions.  Suppose I have an instruction
that performs a SIMD addition on two registers and it can split the
registers into either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bit elements where the element
size is determined by a 2-bit field called SZ in the instruction encoding.
The instruction
definition might look like this:

    integer sz = 8 << UInt(SZ); // calculate element size
    V[d] = Add_SIMD(V[m], V[n], sz)

This is tricky because the function Add_SIMD is going to work on
elements of different sizes.  The way I can eliminate this is by
performing a case-split on the variable SZ:

    case SZ of
        when '00' V[d] = Add_SIMD(V[m], V[n], 8)
        when '01' V[d] = Add_SIMD(V[m], V[n], 16)
        when '10' V[d] = Add_SIMD(V[m], V[n], 32)
        when '11' V[d] = Add_SIMD(V[m], V[n], 64)

Now each call to Add_SIMD operates on a different element width, which
sets us up for the next step in the transformation.

### Monomorphization

Monomorphization is used to simplify polymorphic functions based on the
different calls to the function within the specification.
For example, consider the Add_SIMD function that is used above.

Add_SIMD splits two N-bit values into smaller chunks of length sz,
adds corresponding chunks from the two inputs and returns the
result.

    bits(N) Add_SIMD(bits(N) x, bits(N) y, integer sz)
        assert N MOD sz == 0;
        integer elements = N DIV sz;
        bits(N) result;
        for i = 0 to elements - 1 do
            result[i*sz +: sz] = x[i*sz +: sz] + y[i*sz +: sz];
        return result;

To monomorphize this, I create a separate version for each value of N and of sz
that is used in the specification. For example, for 128-bit values split into
32-bit chunks, I get this version of the function.

    bits(128) Add_SIMD_128_32(bits(128) x, bits(128) y)
        bits(128) result;
        for i = 0 to 3 do
            result[i*32 +: 32] = x[i*32 +: 32] + y[i*32 +: 32];
        return result;

And I then unroll all the loops to get this

    bits(128) Add_SIMD_128_32(bits(128) x, bits(128) y)
        bits(128) result;
        result[0  +: 32] = x[0  +: 32] + y[0  +: 32];
        result[32 +: 32] = x[32 +: 32] + y[32 +: 32];
        result[64 +: 32] = x[64 +: 32] + y[64 +: 32];
        result[96 +: 32] = x[96 +: 32] + y[96 +: 32];
        return result;

After simplifying the types, I work on eliminating
function calls, if-statements and assignments.  The easy
one is function calls: all I have to do is inline every function.

### If-conversion

If-statements and assignments are also quite easy: I use a variant of the
classic "if-conversion" transformation used in vectorizing compilers.  For
example, if I have this code:

    integer x;
    integer y;
    if c then
        x = 1;
        y = 64;
    else
        x = 2;
        y = 32;

then I convert it to this code instead

    integer x = if c then 1 else 2;
    integer y = if c then 64 else 32;

So all I have to do is repeat that transformation systematically
across the entire specification.

### Converting to SMT

Repeating the above for the entire architecture specification
results in a single giant function that consists entirely
of statements of the form

    <type> <variable> = <expression>;

And, once I have that, all I have to do is convert ASL expression
syntax to SMT expression syntax.  For example, the statement:

    integer x = a + b + 1;

is converted to

    (define-const x Int (+ a (+ b 1)))

### The final result

As you might imagine, the result of specializing all instructions,
monomorphizing all functions, unrolling all loops, inlining all functions and
if-converting all conditionals is quite large.  It turns the 15,000 line v8-M
specification into approximately 500,000 lines of SMT.

My favourite solver is the [Z3 SMT
solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki) developed by Leonardo de Moura
and Nikolaj Bj√∏rner.
Thanks to some incredibly good engineering by them and their colleagues
at Microsoft Research, Z3 can easily cope with ridiculously large
inputs like the one that I generate.

# Proving properties

So now I have some properties 
(see [my previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-19-natural-specs %}))
and I have a way to convert ASL to SMT problems.
So it is time to try to prove something.

I have a total of 38 invariants and 23 properties and I want to show two
things:

1. After taking a cold reset (i.e., a power-on reset), all of the invariants
   hold.

2. If all the invariants hold before the processor takes a step then all of
   the invariants and all of the properties hold afterwards.

Let's start with the simplest configuration of the v8-M specification: with
the security features of
TrustZone for M-class disabled.  At the moment, I can prove that all of the
invariants hold after reset and that 36 of the invariants hold and 21 of the
properties hold.  What about the other 4?  One of the properties does not hold.
Either there is a bug in the property or there is a bug in the specification
--- I am not sure which and need to spend more time debugging it.  The proofs
of two of the invariants and one of the properties are timing out: they might
be true, they might be false, I can't tell at the moment.  My main worry here
is the invariants because if they are not true, then any proofs that depend on
them are not sound.  So, for now, I can use this as a tool for finding bugs but
I can't claim that the properties are all guaranteed to hold.

The usual way to show how fast your tool is at proving a set of properties is
to plot a graph that shows how long it takes to prove 10%, 20%, ... 100% of all
the properties.  In [the paper I wrote about this work]({{ site.url
}}/papers/OOPSLA_17/), I split the sets of properties
and invariants up into several different categories so this graph from the
paper has several lines in it (that I won't explain here).  The main thing to
notice is that proofs involving reset do not take very long (because the reset
code has very few choices in it) and that proofs about the transition function
take between a second and 1000 seconds with most of them proved in around 100
seconds.

And what if I enable TrustZone for M-class?  The SMT translation grows to
around 750,000 lines of SMT, and I am able to prove 33 invariants and 19
properties.  Again, I can prove that all the invariants hold after reset and
this time, I have 2 failing properties that I need to debug and I have
5 invariants and 2 properties that are timing out.  Again, this is not perfect,
but it is good enough that I was able to find more bugs so, for now, it is
a great way of improving the quality of the specification.

With the larger size and the ability of the processor to be in either NonSecure
mode or Secure mode, the proof time goes up.  Again, reset properties are
proved very quickly but the proofs are between 3 and 10 times slower.

![Cumulative solution time for Secure configuration of v8-M properties]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/validating-specs-cumS.png)


Of course, the whole point of all this work was to find bugs in the
specification.  All this work has found 12 bugs so far (in a specification that
had already been very thoroughly tested) and I am nowhere near writing all the
properties that I think should hold for the specification.


# Summary

In [my last post about natural language specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
post_url 2017-08-19-natural-specs %}), I talked about the possibility of bugs
in an architecture specification that would not be caught by testcases _no
matter how thorough those tests might be_ and the need for a meta-specification
that specifies cross-cutting properties and invariants of the specification
itself.  I also talked about mining the English prose in the Arm Architecture
Reference Manual for those properties and how I could formalize them.  This
post finishes the story by describing how I could use SMT checkers to prove
that the properties hold and, more importantly, to find bugs in the
specification.

If you want to read more about this, you might want to read
my forthcoming OOPSLA 2017 paper
["Who guards the guards?  Formal Validation of the Arm v8-M Architecture
Specification"]({{ site.url }}/papers/OOPSLA_17/)
that describes the meta-specification language, the properties and the
results in more detail.

------

As a bit of a teaser, let me point out that one thing you can do with
an SMT solver is to prove universally quantified properties as I do here.
But there are lots of other interesting things they can be used for...
