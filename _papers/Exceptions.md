    Using a language without exception handling is like driving
    a car with no brakes and no seatbelt --- things work fine until
    something goes wrong. You also learn to drive rather carefully.
    This paper describes an exception handling extension to the Haskell
    lazy functional language. The implementation turned out to be very
    easy but we had problems finding a viable semantics for our system.
    The resulting semantics is a compromise between theoretical beauty
    and practical utility.
