    Some modern superscalar microprocessors provide only imprecise
    exceptions. That is, they do not guarantee to report the same exception
    that would be encountered by a straightforward sequential execution
    of the program. In exchange, they offer increased performance or
    decreased area (which amount to much the same thing).
    <p>
    This performance/precision tradeoff has not so far been much explored at
    the programming language level. In this paper we propose a design for
    imprecise exceptions in the lazy functional programming language Haskell.
    We discuss various simpler designs, and conclude that imprecision is
    essential if the language is still to enjoy its current rich algebra of
    transformations. We sketch a precise semantics for the language extended
    with exceptions.
    <p>
    From the functional programming point of view, the paper shows how to
    extend Haskell with exceptions without crippling the language or its
    compilers. From the point of view of the wider programming language
    community, we pose the question of whether precision and performance
    can be traded off in other languages too.
