    Interrupt handling is a tricky business in lazy functional
    languages: we have to make sure that thunks that are being evaluated can
    be halted and later restarted if and when they are required. This is
    a particular problem for implementations which use black-holing.
    Black-Holing deliberately makes it impossible to revert such thunks
    to their original state to avoid a serious space leak. Interactive
    Haskell implementations such as Hugs and hbi catch interrupts and
    avoid the problem by omitting or disabling black-holing. Batch mode
    Haskell implementations such as HBC and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
    (GHC) avoid this problem by disabling black-holing or by providing no
    way to catch interrupts. This paper describes a modification to GHC's
    abstract machine (the Spineless Tagless G-Machine) which
    simultaneously supports both interrupts and black-holing.
