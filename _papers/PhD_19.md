    One of the most important interfaces in a computer system is the interface
    between hardware and software.  This interface is the contract between the
    hardware designer and the programmer that defines the functional behaviour of
    the hardware.  This thesis examines two critical aspects of defining the
    hardware-software interface: quality and performance.
    <p>
    The first aspect is creating a high quality specification of the interface as
    conventionally defined in an instruction set architecture.  The majority of
    this thesis is concerned with creating a specification that covers the full
    scope of the interface; that is applicable to all current implementations of
    the architecture; and that can be trusted to accurately describe the behaviour
    of implementations of the architecture.  We describe the development of
    a formal specification of the two major types of Arm processors: A-class (for
    mobile devices such as phones and tablets) and M-class (for micro-controllers).
    These specifications are unparalleled in their scope, applicability and
    trustworthiness.  This thesis identifies and illustrates what we consider the
    key ingredient in achieving this goal: creating a specification that is used by
    many different user groups.  Supporting many different groups leads to improved
    quality as each group finds different problems in the specification; and, by
    providing value to each different group, it helps justify the considerable
    effort required to create a high quality specification of a major processor
    architecture.  The work described in this thesis led to a step change in Arm's
    ability to use formal verification techniques to detect errors in their
    processors; enabled extensive testing of the specification against Arm's
    official architecture conformance suite; improved the quality of Arm's
    architecture conformance suite based on measuring the architectural coverage of
    the tests; supported earlier, faster development of architecture extensions by
    enabling animation of changes as they are being made; and enabled early
    detection of problems created from architecture extensions by performing formal
    validation of the specification against semi-structured natural language
    specifications.  As far as we are aware, no other mainstream processor
    architecture has this capability.  The formal specifications are included in
    Arm's publicly released architecture reference manuals and the A-class
    specification is also released in machine-readable form.
    <p>
    The second aspect is creating a high performance interface by defining the
    hardware-software interface of a software-defined radio subsystem using
    a programming language.  That is, an interface that allows software to exploit
    the potential performance of the underlying hardware.  While the
    hardware-software interface is normally defined in terms of machine code,
    peripheral control registers and memory maps, we define it using a programming
    language instead.  This higher level interface provides the opportunity for
    compilers to hide some of the low-level differences between different systems
    from the programmer: a potentially very efficient way of providing a stable,
    portable interface without having to add hardware to provide portability
    between different hardware platforms.  We describe the design and
    implementation of a set of extensions to the C programming language to support
    programming high performance, energy efficient, software defined radio systems.
    The language extensions enable the programmer to exploit the pipeline
    parallelism typically present in digital signal processing applications and to
    make efficient use of the asymmetric multiprocessor systems designed to support
    such applications.  The extensions consist primarily of annotations that can be
    checked for consistency and that support annotation inference in order to
    reduce the number of annotations required.  Reducing the number of annotations
    does not just save programmer effort, it also improves portability by reducing
    the number of annotations that need to be changed when porting an application
    from one platform to another.  This work formed part of a project that
    developed a high-performance, energy-efficient, software defined radio capable
    of implementing the physical layers of the 4G cellphone standard (LTE), 802.11a
    WiFi and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) with a power and silicon area budget
    that was competitive with a conventional custom ASIC solution.
    <p>
    The Arm architecture is the largest computer architecture by volume in the
    world.  It behooves us to ensure that the interface it describes is
    appropriately defined.
