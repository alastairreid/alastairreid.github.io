    Software Defined Radio(SDR) is an emerging paradigm for wireless
    terminals, in which the physical layer of communication
    protocols is implemented in software rather than by ASICs. Many
    of the current and next generation wireless protocols include
    Turbo coding because of its superior performance. However, Turbo
    decoding is computationally intensive, and its low power
    implementations have typ- ically been in ASICs. This paper
    presents a case study of algorithm-architecture co-design of
    Turbo decoder for SDR. We present a programmable DSP architecture
    for SDR that includes a set of architectural features to
    accelerate Turbo decoder computations. We then present a parallel
    window scheduling for MAX-Log-MAP component decoder that
    matches well with the DSP architecture. Finally, we present
    a software implementation of Turbo decoder for W-CDMA on the DSP
    architecture and show that it achieves 2Mbps decoding throughput.
