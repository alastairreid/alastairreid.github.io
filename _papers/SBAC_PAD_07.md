    In this paper, we propose two low-cost and novel branch history
    buffer handling schemes aiming at skewing the branch prediction
    accuracy in favor of a real-time thread for a soft real-time
    embedded multithreaded processor. The processor core accommodates
    two running threads, one with the highest priority and the other
    thread is a background thread, and both threads share the branch
    predictor. The first scheme uses a 3-bit branch history buffer in
    which the highest priority thread uses the most significant
    2 bits to change the prediction state while the background thread
    uses only the least significant 2 bits. The second scheme uses
    the shared 2-bit branch history buffer that implements integer
    updates for the highest priority thread but fractional updates
    for the background thread in order to achieve relatively higher
    prediction accuracy in the highest priority thread. The low cost
    nature of these two schemes, particularly in the second scheme,
    makes them attractive with moderate improvement in the
    performance of the highest priority thread.
