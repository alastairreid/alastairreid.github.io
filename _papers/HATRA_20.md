abstract: |
    Formal verification of software is a bit of a niche
    activity: it is only applied to the most safety-critical or
    security-critical software and it is typically only performed by
    specialized verification engineers. This paper considers whether
    it would be possible to increase adoption of formal methods by
    integrating formal methods with developers' existing practices
    and workflows.
    <p>
    We do not believe that widespread adoption will follow from
    making the prevailing formal methods argument that correctness
    is more important than engineering teams realize. Instead, our
    focus is on what we would need to do to enable programmers to
    make effective use of formal verification tools and techniques.
    We do this by considering how we might make verification tooling
    that both serves developers' needs and fits into their existing
    development lifecycle. We propose a target of two orders of
    magnitude increase in adoption within a decade driven by
    ensuring a positive `weekly cost-benefit' ratio for developer
    time invested.
