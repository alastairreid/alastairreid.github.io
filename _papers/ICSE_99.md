    We describe the transformation of XVision, a large library of
    C++ code for real-time vision processing, into FVision (pronounced
    ``fission''), a fully-featured domain-specific language embedded
    in Haskell. The resulting prototype system substantiates the claims
    of increased modularity, effective code reuse, and rapid prototyping
    that characterize the DSL approach to system design. It also
    illustrates the need for judicious interface design: relegating
    computationally expensive tasks to XVision (pre-existing C++
    components), and leaving modular compositional tasks to
    FVision (Haskell). At the same time, our experience demonstrates how
    Haskell's advanced language features (specifically parametric
    polymorphism, lazy evaluation, higher order functions and
    automatic storage reclamation) permit a rapid DSL design that
    is itself highly modular and easily modified. Overall, the resulting
    hybrid system exceeded our expectations: visual tracking programs
    continue to spend most of their time executing low level
    image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced features allow us to
    quickly develop and test small prototype systems within a matter of
    a few days and to develop realistic applications within a few weeks.
