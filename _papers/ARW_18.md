    Processor instruction set architectures (ISAs) are typically
    specified using a mixture of prose and pseudocode. We present
    ongoing work on expressing such specifications rigorously and
    automatically trans- lating them to interactive theorem prover
    definitions, making them amenable to mechanised proof. Our ISA
    descriptions are written in Sail— a custom ISA specification
    language designed to support idioms from var- ious processor
    vendor’s pseudocode, with lightweight dependent typing for
    bitvectors, targeting a variety of use cases including
    sequential and concurrent ISA semantics. From Sail we aim to
    portably generate usable theorem prover definitions for
    multiple provers, including Isabelle, HOL4, and Coq. We are
    focusing on the full ARMv8.3-A specification, CHERI-MIPS, and
    RISC-V, together with fragments of IBM POWER and x86.
