    An important correctness criterion for software running on
    embedded microcontrollers is stack safety: a guarantee that the
    call stack does not overflow. Our first contribution is a method
    for statically guaranteeing stack safety of interrupt-driven
    embedded software using an approach based on context-sensitive
    dataflow analysis of object code. We have implemented a prototype
    stack analysis tool that targets software for Atmel AVR
    microcontrollers and tested it on embedded applications compiled
    from up to 30,000 lines of C. We experimentally validate the
    accuracy of the tool, which runs in under 10 sec on the largest
    programs that we tested. The second contribution of this paper is
    the development of two novel ways to reduce stack memory
    requirements of embedded software.
