    Design patterns are a valuable mechanism for emphasizing
    structure, capturing design expertise, and facilitating restructuring of
    software systems. Patterns are typically applied in the context of an
    object-oriented language and are implemented so that the pattern
    participants correspond to object instances that are created and
    connected at run-time. This paper describes a complementary
    realization of design patterns, in which many pattern participants
    correspond to statically instantiated and connected components.Our
    approach separates the static parts of the software design from the
    dynamic parts of the system behavior. This separation makes the
    software design more amenable to analysis, thus enabling more
    effective and domain-specific detection of system design errors,
    prediction of run-time behavior, and more effective optimization. This
    technique is applicable to imperative, functional, and
    object-oriented languages: we have extended C, Scheme, and Java with
    our component model. In this paper, we illustrate our approach in the
    context of the OSKit, a collection of operating system components
    written in C.
