## Talks

<h3>Rust Verification</h3>

Talks about the [Rust verification project](https://project-oak.github.io/rust-verification-tools/)
at Google.

  - How can we formally verify Rust for Linux
    <br>
    [Kangrejos](https://kangrejos.com/)
    (workshop attached to [Linux Plumbers 2021](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/13/timetable/#20210913.detailed)).

    Virtual.
    <br>
    13 September 2021.
    [[pdf]](talks/Kangrejos-2021-09-13.pdf)

    This talk describes the state of formal verification for Rust code in the
    Linux kernel based on the
    [blog posts]({% post_url 2021-08-22-rust-on-linux-1 %})
    I wrote.

    [[transcript]](https://building-better-systems.simplecast.com/episodes/11-alastair-reid-meeting-developers-where-they-are-TSRN2M5n/transcript)

    This 36 minute interview with Joey Dodds and Shpat Morina at Galois focuses on adoption and usability of verification tools
    and where we sit on the spectrum from high-assurance/high-cost to lower-assurance/lower-cost.


  - Using KLEE with Large Rust Programs
    <br>
    [KLEE workshop 2021](https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/klee21/)
    <br>
    Virtual (London, UK).
    11 June 2021.
    [[pdf]](talks/using-KLEE-with-Rust-2021-07-11.pdf)
    [[video]](https://youtu.be/zR7oDg7zix0)

    This 12 minute talk focuses on tools: what we have done to adapt KLEE for use with Rust;
    the language, compiler, library and linker features we have encountered in real
    code out in the wild;
    and how we have tried to solve issues in a way that other Rust verification tools can directly use or adapt.


<h3>The Hardware-Software Interface: Quality and Performance</h3>

_One of the most important interfaces in a computer system is the
interface between hardware and software.
This talk examines two critical aspects of defining the
hardware-software interface: quality and performance._

_The first aspect concerns the "radical" idea of creating a single,
high-quality, formal specification of microprocessors that everybody
can use.
This idea does not seem "radical" until you realize that standard
practice is for every group to create their own version of a
specification in their preferred toolchain.
I will describe the challenges that lead to this behavior and how to
overcome the challenges.
This project lead to the creation of Arm's official formal
specification of their microprocessors and to the formal validation of
Arm's processors against that specification._

_The second aspect concerns the tradeoff between portability and
performance in the context of high performance, energy efficient,
parallel systems.
I will describe the challenges in balancing portability and
performance and how I overcame them by defining the hardware-software
interface in terms of extensions of the C language.
This project played a key part in creation of a software-defined radio
system capable of implementing the 4G cellphone protocol._

_The Arm architecture is the largest computer architecture by volume in
the world; it behooves us to ensure that the interface it describes is
appropriately defined._

<h3>Engineering and Using Large Formal Specifications</h3>

_We have great tools and technique to formally verify hardware and software but,
if we are apply these to real world systems, we need high quality
specifications of real world artifacts such as processors, OSes, libraries,
programming languages and internet protocols.
This talk is about how we are going to avoid a specification bottleneck - it
uses my experience in formalising the ARM processor architecture to suggest an
approach that we can use on other large, complex hardware and software to
create the specifications we need._

    <br>
    Keynote talk,

<h3>What makes processors fail - and how to prevent it</h3>

A more accessible presentation of the ideas in the [ISA-Formal paper](_papers/CAV_16.md)
for the Electromagnetic Field maker festival.

_Modern processors are amazing devices: small, fast, low power and getting
better with every generation.  But the most amazing things about modern
microprocessors is that they work so incredibly reliably despite all their
incredible complexity._

_This talk is about the battle between complexity and correctness and about how
new formal verification tools can be used to help you design higher performance
processors that actually work.  I will describe the common optimisations, the
bugs that these often introduce and how open source tools such as SAT solvers
and bounded model checkers can be used to find these bugs._

<h3>Creating Formal Specifications of the Arm Processor Architecture</h3>

_A talk about why creating formal specifications for real world systems
is hard and what we can do about it.
Some of the key problems are the semantic gap between the architects’ intention
and the written specification; challenges persuading different groups to adopt
a common specification; the number and diversity of existing implementations;
and the practical impossibility of formally verifying all implementations
against the specification.
I discuss lessons learned when creating a formal specification of the Arm
Processor Architecture and using that specification to formally validate
processors against the specification.  And I discuss how those lessons can be
applied in other contexts.  This includes use of traditional testing, formal
validation, social engineering and building a virtuous cycle to drive up the
quality of the specification._
